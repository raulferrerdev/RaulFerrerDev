**User interface (UI) [testing](https://raulferrer.dev/blog/intro_to_testing_in_swift/)** is a crucial step in the software development process that enables us to make sure the user interface of our program is accurate, dependable, and simple to use. The **XCUITest** framework will be used to demonstrate excellent **UI testing** in Swift in this article.


# Why testing the UI?
**User interface (UI) testing** is important for a number of reasons:

* **UI tests** assist us in identifying aesthetic and layout flaws that other types of tests might miss.
* We may test an application from beginning to end using **UI tests**, emulating the user experience.
* Regressions are more easily caught and existing functionality is not broken by UI changes thanks to **UI testing**.

#Â Establishing an Xcode UI testing target
We must configure a **UI testing target** in Xcode before we can begin creating **UI tests** in Swift. Follow these steps to accomplish this:

* Launch the Xcode project.
* From the menu, choose *File > New > Target*.
* Then select *iOS > Test > UI Test Target* in the *Target Template* window.
* After naming your **UI testing target**, click *Next*.
* To build the **UI testing target**, click *Finish*.
* The *Project Navigator* window will display both your application target and your UI testing target.

# Writing UI test cases
The **XCUITest** framework is used to create UI test cases in Swift. A set of tools and APIs are provided by **XCUITest** for creating and performing **UI tests** in Xcode.

We create a subclass of **XCTestCase** and add methods to the subclass that include our test code in order to write a **UI test case**. Typically, *test* word precedes these methods, as in *testExample()*.

A simple *UI test case* that evaluates a login form is shown here:

```swift
import XCTest

class MyUITests: XCTestCase {
    func testLogin() {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()
        
        let emailTextField = app.textFields["Email"]
        emailTextField.tap()
        emailTextField.typeText("test@example.com")
        
        let passwordTextField = app.secureTextFields["Password"]
        passwordTextField.tap()
        passwordTextField.typeText("password")
        
        app.buttons["Log In"].tap()
        
        // Verify that the user is logged in
        XCTAssertTrue(app.isDisplayingHomeScreen)
    }
}
```

In this example, we open the app and use the login form to enter test values into the email and password text fields by tapping on them. The user is then logged in once we touch the *Log In* button and make sure the app is showing the home screen.

We can utilize the *Test* button in the Xcode toolbar or the *Command + U* keyboard shortcut to execute the **UI tests** in our test case. As indicated in the test case, Xcode will start the app and run the tests while interacting with the UI.

# Guidelines for efficient UI testing
Here are some pointers for creating efficient Swift **UI tests**:

* Give your tests names that are illustrative. It will be simpler to comprehend what each test is checking as a result.
* To locate elements in the UI, use **XCUIElement** queries. TextFields, buttons, and tables are just a few of the attributes that can be used by **XCUIElement** to discover elements.
* For UI interaction, use **XCUIElement** actions. *Tap*, *typeText*, and *swipeLeft* are just a few of the ways that **XCUIElement** allows users to interact with its elements.
* To confirm the UI's state, use **XCTAssert** statements. There are numerous ways to check if items contain the appropriate properties, including *exists*, *isSelected*, and *isHittable*, according to **XCTAssert**.
* Make sure not to hardcode element identifiers. Instead, define distinct identifiers for UI elements using AccessibilityIdentifier, then utilize those identities to locate those elements in your tests. Your tests will be more resistant to UI changes as a result.

# Best practices for UI testing
Here are some Swift **UI testing** best practices:

* Maintain focus in **UI tests**. One particular UI feature should be tested in a **UI test** at a time. A test shouldn't test several unrelated items at once.
* Keep the **UI testing** separate. The outcomes of other tests shouldn't affect **UI tests**. Each test should prepare and disassemble its own test environment and data.
* Don't test implementation specifics. The user experience, not the UI implementation, should be the main emphasis of **UI tests**.
* Tests shouldn't be conducted on UI components that the user cannot see. Only aspects that the user can see and interact with should be subjected to UI testing.
* Utilize a testing approach that is suitable for your application. Think about whether you want to test the UI at the integration level or at the unit level (testing individual components separately) (testing how elements work together).


# Conclusion
This post demonstrated how to create efficient Swift **UI tests** that make use of the **XCUITest** library. We learned how to locate and interact with UI elements using **XCUIElement** queries and actions, as well as how to use **XCTAssert** statements to confirm the UI's current state. We also discussed various UI testing best practices, such as maintaining isolated, focused tests and conducting user-centered testing.

You can create trustworthy and efficient UI tests for your Swift applications by heeding these recommendations and utilizing the resources offered by the **XCUITest** framework.
