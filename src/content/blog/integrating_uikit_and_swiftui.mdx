## From UIKit to SwiftUI

Developers have a new tool, **SwiftUI**, to create user interfaces that are far more user-friendly and cutting-edge than those created using **UIKit**. For developers who have put a lot of time and effort into understanding and using **UIKit**, the switch to **SwiftUI** might not be as simple. In some circumstances, you might also want to recycle previously created UIKit code or interface elements.

Luckily, **SwiftUI**'s interaction with **UIKit** offers a solution for these situations. This post will examine how to combine **UIKit** with **SwiftUI**, the advantages of doing so, and any potential drawbacks.


### What is UIKit?

For the purpose of creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Apple platforms, the **UIKit** framework offers a selection of user interface elements and tools. With the initial release of the iOS SDK, it has served as the main framework for creating iOS and iPadOS apps.

###Â What is SwiftUI?

A new framework called **SwiftUI** was released in 2019 and offers a declarative syntax for creating user interfaces for Apple systems. Using **SwiftUI**, you can describe the layout and behavior of your user interface in a way that is far more intuitive and natural than with **UIKit**, which takes a programmatic approach to creating user interfaces.

## SwiftUI in UIKit integration

Using a **UIHostingController** to enclose a **SwiftUI** view inside a **UIKit** view is how **SwiftUI** is integrated with **UIKit**. A UIViewController subclass called a **UIHostingController** provides the framework required to embed a **SwiftUI** view inside a **UIKit** view hierarchy.

You must first create a **SwiftUI** view that you want to embed inside your **UIKit** view hierarchy in order to use a **UIHostingController**. Create a struct for this view that follows the View protocol. Once you've created your **SwiftUI** view, you can use it as a **UIHostingController**'s root view.

Here's an example of how a **UIHostingController** may be used to incorporate a **SwiftUI** view into a **UIKit** view hierarchy:

```swift
import UIKit
import SwiftUI

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: MySwiftUIView())
        addChild(hostingController)
        view.addSubview(hostingController.view)
        hostingController.didMove(toParent: self)
    }
}

struct MySwiftUIView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```
### Advantages of SwiftUI into UIKit integration

**SwiftUI** views integration into **UIKit** views has some advantages:

* **Better user interface.** **SwiftUI** views have a contemporary and unified design that can improve the aesthetics and usability of your project.
* **Faster development.** **SwiftUI** views can be created more quickly and easily than **UIKit** views, especially for straightforward user interfaces. You can save time and money by doing this.
* **Declarative syntax.** **SwiftUI** employs a declarative syntax, which allows you to specify how you want your interface to appear while leaving the implementation details to the framework.
* **Automatic view updating.** SwiftUI refreshes your views automatically as the underlying data changes, cutting down on the amount of code you need to write.

### Disadvantages of SwiftUI into UIKit integration
**SwiftUI** views integration into **UIKit** views has also some disadvantages:

* **Compatibility.** Because some **UIKit** views are incompatible with **SwiftUI**, your options may be constrained and their integration may necessitate writing bespoke code.
* **Added complexity.** If you need to manage several view hierarchies, integrating **SwiftUI** and **UIKit** views can make your program more difficult.
* **Maintenance burden.** Because you must maintain both the **SwiftUI** and **UIKit** code, integrating **SwiftUI** and **UIKit** views might increase the maintenance burden of your app.

## UIKit in SwiftUI integration


In order to use a **UIKit** view inside **SwiftUI** you need to use the **UIViewRepresentable** protocol. This allows you to use a UIView subclass in your **SwiftUI** views:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MyUIViewWrapper: UIViewRepresentable {
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> MyUIView {
        return MyUIView()
    }
    func updateUIView(_ uiView: MyUIView, context: Context) {
        // Update the view here
    }
}

class MyUIView: UIView {
    // Implement your UIView subclass here
}

struct MySwiftUIView: View {
    var body: some View {
        MyUIViewWrapper()
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a **UIViewRepresentable** struct, *MyUIViewWrapper*, which conforms to the **UIViewRepresentable** protocol. Then we then implement the *makeUIView(context:)* method, which creates and returns an instance of our wrapped *MyUIView*. 
We also implement the *updateUIView(_:context:)* method, which allows us to update the wrapped *MyUIView* based on changes to the **SwiftUI** view or its environment. Finally, we can use our *MyUIViewWrapper* in **SwiftUI** views just like any other **SwiftUI** view.


### Advantages of UIKit into SwiftUI integration

Integrating UIKit into SwiftUI has a number of advantages:

* **Reusing existing UIKit code.** If you wish to reuse existing **UIKit** code, you may use a **UIHostingController** to embed it inside a **SwiftUI** view hierarchy. This enables you to continue using your current **UIKit** code while making the switch to **SwiftUI** gradually.

* **Improved performance.** As **SwiftUI** is intended to be more performant than **UIKit**, your app's performance may be improved by embedding **UIKit** views within a **SwiftUI** view hierarchy.

* **Better code maintainability.** Compared to *UIKit*'s programmatic approach, **SwiftUI**'s declarative syntax is simpler to comprehend and maintain in your code.

### Disadvantages of UIKit and SwiftUI Integration

Despite the advantages, it's important to be aware of a few restrictions when integrating **UIKit** with **SwiftUI**:

* **Compatibility.** Not every UIKit component can be integrated into a SwiftUI view hierarchy. UITableView and UICollectionView, for instance, are not supported at the moment.

* **Increased complexity.** Combining **UIKit** with **SwiftUI** can make your code more complex, especially if you're switching from a codebase that only uses **UIKit**.

* **Maintenance costs.** Keeping up with two different codebases for **UIKit** and **SwiftUI** can be time-consuming and raise your app's maintenance costs.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, integrating UIKit and SwiftUI views can offer a range of benefits for app development. Combining these frameworks can provide developers with more flexibility, allowing them to use the best tools for specific tasks while still maintaining a cohesive user interface.
