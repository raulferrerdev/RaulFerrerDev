A typical UI component that may be used to collect user inputs in a systematic manner is the form. We'll explore advanced **SwiftUI** form-building tools and strategies in this tutorial.


## What's a SwiftUI Form
A **Form** in **SwiftUI** is a container view that arranges its child views into a single column. By default, the form is scrollable, allowing the user to view all of the material if it fills the entire screen height.

```swift
Form {
    TextField("Username", text: $username)
    TextField("Password", text: $password)
    TextField("Street", text: $street)
    TextField("City", text: $city)
    TextField("Zip code", text: $zipCode)
}
```

In this example, the created form has five TextField elements, all related to a common user sign up form: username, password, street...

## Using Section to group controls

As we saw in the [chapter of SwiftUI Lists](https://raulferrer.dev/blog/swiftui_cs11_list/), the **Section** view in SwiftUI can be used to group related controls together. The **Section** view accepts an optional header parameter for displaying a header above the controls. For instance, you could design a form with two sections like this:

```swift
Form {
    Section(header: Text("Account Information")) {
        TextField("Username", text: $username)
        SecureField("Password", text: $password)
    }

    Section(header: Text("Address")) {
        TextField("Street", text: $street)
        TextField("City", text: $city)
        TextField("Zip code", text: $zipCode)
    }
}
```
So, in this case, we have grouped the five TextField elements from the previous example into to sections: one for the account information (username and password) and the second, for the address input.

## Changing the appearance of Forms
When it comes to customizing the appearance of forms, **SwiftUI** offers a [lot of options](https://raulferrer.dev/blog/swiftui_ch3_vstack_modifiers/). For example, you can change the form's background color, padding, and even add custom dividers between sections.

```swift
Form {
    Section(header: Text("Account Information")) {
        TextField("Username", text: $username)
        SecureField("Password", text: $password)
    }

    Section(header: Text("Address")) {
        TextField("Street", text: $street)
        TextField("City", text: $city)
        TextField("Zip code", text: $zipCode)
    }
}
.background(Color.yellow)
.padding()
```

Remember that **SwiftUI** has a lot of modifiers to custom appearance:

* **.background.** Changes the background color or image of the form.

* **.padding.** Adds padding around the edges of the form.

* **.frame.** Changes the size and position of the form within its parent view.

* **.shadow.** Adds a shadow to the form.

* **.cornerRadius.** Changes the corner radius of the form.

* **.clipShape.** Clips the form to a custom shape.

* **.disabled.** Disables the form, making it unresponsive to user interaction.

* **.opacity.** Changes the opacity of the form.

* **.hidden.** Hides the form if set to true.

## Adding custom Form controls
In addition to the **SwiftUI** built-in controls, you can also create custom form controls in **SwiftUI**. For example, let's create a custom toggle that displays the label to the right of the toggle instead of to the left. To do this, you can use the HStack and Toggle views:
```swift
    struct CustomToggle: View {
    @Binding var isOn: Bool
    var label: String

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Toggle(isOn: $isOn)
            Text(label)
        }
    }
}
```
Then, we add this custom control to our **Form**:

```swift
Form {
    Section(header: Text("Account Information")) {
        TextField("Username", text: $username)
        SecureField("Password", text: $password)
    }

    Section(header: Text("Address")) {
        TextField("Street", text: $street)
        TextField("City", text: $city)
        TextField("Zip code", text: $zipCode)
    }

    Section(header: Text("Preferences")) {
        CustomToggle(isOn: $receiveEmails, label: "Receive emails")
        CustomToggle(isOn: $receiveNotifications, label: "Receive notifications")
    }
}
```


## Conclusion
**Forms** are an essential component of any app that requires user input, and creating forms with **SwiftUI** has never been easier. You can group related controls into sections, change the form's appearance, and even create custom form controls. I hope this article has helped you better understand **SwiftUI**'s advanced features and techniques for creating forms.
