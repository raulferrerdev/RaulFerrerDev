## Data access
Nowadays,for **data access** most mobile applications have an internal database (Core Data, Realm â€¦) to store information, which can then be used, for example, if the application does not have an internet connection.



If for **data access** we want to implement a database in our application following SOLID principles, we must take into account:

* The database layer should not be exposed to controllers (ViewControllers).
* CRUD operations in the database can only be called from a service class.
* The database layer should allow changing the type of database in the future (for example, from Core Data to Realm), affecting as little as possible the application code.
* The objects or entities of the database must not be exposed outside the database layer.

## StoreManager protocol

First, we must establish a protocol that declares the methods for interacting with the database. To decouple the type of object that these methods receive with the type of database, we will establish a protocol, Storable, that all objects must adopt:

```swift
protocol Storable { }

extension Object: Storable { } // For Realm database
extension NSManagedObject: Storable { } // For Core Data database
```

Now we can develop the StorageManager protocol:

```swift
protocol StorageManager {
  /// Save Object into Realm database
  /// - Parameter object: Realm object (as Storable)
  func save(object: Storable) throws

  /// Save array of objects into Realm database
  /// - Parameter objects: Array of Realm objects (as Storable)
  func saveAll(objects: [Storable]) throws

  /// Update object on Realm database
  /// - Parameter object: Realm object (as Storable)
  func update(object: Storable) throws

  /// Delete Object on Realm database
  /// - Parameter object: Realm object (as Storable)
  func delete(object: Storable) throws

  /// Delete all objects of a given Realm type
  /// - Parameter model: Realm model (as Storable)
  func deleteAll(_ model: Storable.Type) throws

  /// Fetch objects
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - model: Realm object model (as Storable)
  ///   - predicate: Predicate
  ///   - sorted: Sorted object (as Storable)
  func fetch(_ model: Storable.Type,
             predicate: NSPredicate?,
             sorted: Sorted?) -> [Storable]

  /// Delete all objects in database
  func reset() throws
}
```

Where *Sorted* is a struct that allows us to sort the results obtained through a specific parameter (*key*):

```swift
struct Sorted {
  var key: String
  var ascending: Bool = true
}
```



## Conclusion

On **data access**, we can decouple de database layer of our apps, following SOLID principles. This will allow us, for example, change database type in our app with few changes.
